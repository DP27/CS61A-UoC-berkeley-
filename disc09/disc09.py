   1. Define an generator function that combines two input iterators using a given combiner function. 
   The resulting iterator should have a size equal to the size of the shorter
   of its two input iterators.
   Test Cases:

   >>> evens = combiner(gen_naturals(), gen_naturals(), add)
   >>> next(evens)
   0
   >>> next(evens)
   2

3. Write a generator function that returns all subsets of the positive integers from 1 to
